### Analysis of competing websites
We have completed our webstie with some other providers/websites. We found that some of the ways are different in our webiste than others. For example:
- Our webiste is ordering the food from suppliers directly and automatically counts the stock in the restaurant which is new on the website of restaurants I have not seen on any other restaurant website
- On our online orders from website sets earning points for the cutomers which can attract customers. That I have not seen on any other websites, for example Zomato
